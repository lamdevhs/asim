TODO:
  make so pinMode checks the expected value of the mode based on what kind
  of object the pin is bound to via init();
  * allow rgbLED to only have two or even one color, without
  having to give dummy pin numbers
  use static to try to avoid polluting the namespace of client code
  what happens if analog is sent to an INPUT connected to an interrupt?
  cases:
    calling write/read/analog for wrong types
    defining a button/diode/etc for wrong type
    handle pullup thing better
    delay when ardu.interrupted
check:
    what happens when you try to set the value
    of something connected to a button
    (if it's INPUT, in theory, it changes the pullup option value)
  
ideas:
  * pause button (but can still use buttons to modify state,
  and therefore execute interruptions)
  * freeze button (stop everything)
  * print to display anything
  * print static titles in between virtual objects
  * print value of some variable in real time (with pointer)
    * maybe permit to give an array of symbolic strings
    * to replace the dry int version
    * esp for booleans
  * change display to reflect any order the use wants
  * allows adding separations in the display
  * make the display of all virtual objects generic:
  typedef struct visible {
    void *object;
    void (*printer)(void *object);
  } Visible;

  * use malloc instead of static sizes of displayed text
  * the functions used to create virtual objects must NOT work
    outside of the init function!!!! and arduino() MUST
    be called before anything else!

security:
   * test for char *name pointers to be null
   * malloc failures?



different types of errors:
- bugs: which should never happen. crash (program can't tell what to do)
- failure: filled up all the static memory for virtual objects, for example.
    in a reasonable usage, it should never happen. crash or error report.
- user error: wrong use of a pin, of a function. either crash, or error report.

warnings;
- doubtful user usage of some function (like digitalWrite on an input,
  which changes the pullup state)

---------------------------------------------

// pinMode
//   if prevmode != NONE: error
// attachInterrupt
//   -> event listener
// digitalWrite
//   if mode != OUTPUT: error
//   -> event listener
// digitalRead
//   if mode != INPUT: error

// ---analogRead
// analogWrite
// delay
// timers

// create buttons,
// define names for colors, etc
// ardu
// initialize global var `arduino`
// create event listeners (buttons, etc)
// call setup: modifies `arduino` and event handling
// forever:
//   call loop (only sets a list of things to do)
//   while todo not empty
//     do one thing
//       case of delay: merely defines a variable to decrement depending on time spent... except time spend during interruptions
//     check kb event, if true: launch listener
//     else: redo

// three threads: simulator, printer, and listener
// listener modifies state of buttons, and calls interruptions (or maybe puts it as next todo, in delay or outside of loop)
// simulator loops over loop, maybe calls interruptions
// printer continuously prints the state of the system (read only)
